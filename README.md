# Sorting Algorithms
### Description
A collection of sorting algorithms implemented in C to see the advantages and disadvantages of each one of them

with Time Compexity 

## Usage 
In order to use this , 

Clone This Repo

`` git clone  https://github.com/Theemiss/sorting_algorithms.git ``

Creat your main file with specifc Requirment 

compile it with  

`gcc 4.8.4 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic {File Name Based on the sort You want} print_array.c print_list.c -o sort` .  
You can then run it by invoking `./sort` in that same directory.  

## Bubble Sort
A slow sorting algorithm for the simplest data sets

| Case  | Performance |
| :---: | :---: |
| Worst case performance   | O(n^2)  |
| Best case performance  | O(n)  |
| Average case performance  | O(n^2)  |


## Selection Sort

Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations

| Case  | Performance |
| :---: | :---: |
| Worst case performance   | O(n^2)  |
| Best case performance  | O(n^2)  |
| Average case performance  | O(n^2)  |

## Quick sort

Quick Sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that is more effective than other O(nlogn) algorithms for large datasets that fit in memory, but is unstable. Quick Sort in general does not requiere extra space

| Case  | Performance |
| :---: | :---: |
| Worst case performance   | O(n^2)  |
| Best case performance  | O(n log n)  |
| Average case performance  | O(n log n)  |
